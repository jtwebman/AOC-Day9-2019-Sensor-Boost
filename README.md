# Advent of Code - Day 9 - 2019: Sensor Boost

This is my [Advent of Code day 9 solution](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/9).

Code here: [/lib/](/lib/)

Tests here: [/test/](/test/)

Pulled code from day 7 and switch the instructions to a map from a list to make it much faster to access and write single values.

Would love any feedback!

## Tests

The tests are more integration tests then unit tests and they can be ran:

```
mix test
```

## Part 1 Solution

```
iex -S mix
Day9.part1()
```

## Part 2 Solution

```
iex -S mix
Day9.part2()
```
